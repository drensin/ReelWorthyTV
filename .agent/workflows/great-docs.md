description: makes sure that all source files follow style guidelines and that docs are up to date
---

Go online and find the Google readability and style guide for Kotlin and Java.  Carefully inspect all .kt files in this workspace and make sure that they strictly and confidently follow all readability guidelines. Make sure that all methods are properly documented - including all input/output parms and that all lengthy blocks of code are liberally commented for maximum readability by a competent developer new to this particular code base.

Next, carefully read all README.md files in the ReelWorthyTV root directory and ALL subdirectories. Make sure that the information in EACH of those files is up-to-date and accurate with respect to the code in the .kt files. The .kt source code is canonical. If you find that any of the README.md files need to be updated, DO NOT modify them. Instead, for each file that needs to be updated please tell me what updates you propose to make and seek my permission. We should iterate like that through each of the README.md files you find that need to be updated.
